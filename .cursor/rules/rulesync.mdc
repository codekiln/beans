# Rulesync in Beans

This repo uses Rulesync to keep AI tool rules and commands consistent across editors and agents. It reads the unified rules and command templates under `.rulesync/` and generates tool-specific files with `npx rulesync generate`.

## Devcontainer install

The devcontainer installs Rulesync globally for easy CLI access in `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh`:

```bash
npm install -g rulesync
```

## Local usage

Rulesync is also listed in `devDependencies`, so you can run it with:

```bash
npx rulesync generate
```
