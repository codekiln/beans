# Fonts

This repo defaults to JetBrains Mono for the CLI-inspired UI and editor experience.

## Install JetBrains Mono

Follow the official installation guide:

```text
https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#how-to-install
```

## Use it in VS Code

`.vscode/settings.json` already prefers JetBrains Mono. Once the font is installed,
restart VS Code if it does not pick it up automatically.
