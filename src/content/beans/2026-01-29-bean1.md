## Observations
- First cup with the Sojourner Blend; baseline run to set a reference.
- Aroma reads warm and grounded, with a sweeter finish than the Mocha Java.
- Body is medium and steady, with a soft trailing finish.

## Brew log
- Preheated brewer and mug before grinding.
- Gentle clockwise pour; filled by ~1:05 with the switch closed.
- Released at 2:30; steady drawdown without stall.
