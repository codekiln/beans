### Observations
- Context: early, pre-dawn quiet; calm and grounded; no music noted.
- Bag notes: balanced, sweet dark fruits, earthy chocolate.
- Blend components: Ethiopian, Sumatran, Guatemalan.
- Aroma: sweet, muted.
- First sip: gentle, immediately flavorful.
- Second sip: full-bodied and satisfying.
- Acidity: low overall, mostly felt at the back of the tongue.
- Sweetness: thin in quality, reads as dark chocolate.
- Bitterness: an edge, cocoa-like rather than roasty.
- Body/mouthfeel: round weight with a watery texture.
- Finish: short, sides of the tongue; overall expressive.
- Overall: present and coherent without heaviness; flavor feels broad rather than pointed.
- Reflection: less earthy than expected, anchored by dark chocolate. The uneven bed suggests late dribbles disturbed the surface; tightening the final pour toward center may help even extraction without losing the cup’s breadth.

### Brew log
- Easy Immersion plan with the switch closed for a 2:30 steep.
- Dose split: 14.3 g Sojourner + ~1.7 g residual August blend.
- Full preheat for brewer and mug via filter rinse.
- Grind unchanged from yesterday; one bean dropped and replaced (~0.1 g correction).
- Pouring stayed consistent, though late-stage dribbles likely disturbed the bed.
- 0:00 water in, 2:30 switch opened, ~3:30 drawdown complete.
- Bed looked uneven with larger holes forming during drawdown.
