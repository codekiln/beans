### Context
Insomnia last night. A bit of midnight knowledge gardening, courtesy of Codex in the ChatGPT app.

Feeling foggy.

### Listening
Alfred Brendel playing Beethoven's _Diabelli Variations_.

### Brew Notes
Pretty straightforward brew. No errors.

Preheat draw used 309 g of purified water.

Present. Not listening to anything. Light discussion of last night's dreams.

Need to remember to order new cone filters for the Hario Switch.

### Observations

#### Groundsniff

> Deep purple color. Three-dimensional. -- 🦄

Complex.

#### Tasting
First sip: bitter wrinkle.
Sips 3-4: coffee oils, side of tongue, softening the blur.
Wet and hot. Palate not awake.
A serrated slide, too fine to slice the sips.
