### Observations
- Bed looks mostly even with a slight density gradient.
- Curious whether early drip-through subtly affects extraction.
- Intent was a controlled coarser probe after strong results yesterday.

### Brew log
- Patagonia mug preheated before the brew.
- Single clockwise pour with all water in by 1:40.
- Switch was accidentally open at the start; minor drip-through in the first ~10 seconds.
- Switch closed at ~2:34; drawdown after switch ~1:06.
- Slightly coarser grind to probe flavor impact after yesterday.
