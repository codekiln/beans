### Context
- Walking out the door a little early.
- About 17°F, clean cold air, sidewalks well scooped.

### Listening
Isaac Albéniz, _Iberia Suite_, played by Claudio Arrau on piano.

That opening space in Evocación landed well. One sip, one breath, one phrase.

### Brew Notes
Measured 300 g of water before preheat. Preheat draw ran high and left the brew short of target.

Timer start was nearly missed again, like cup one, but caught within about two seconds.

Simulated RDT this time: a few water droplets on the beans, then a quick shake before grinding.

### Observations

#### Grounds aroma report 

> earthy, like a chicken coop --🦄 

#### Tasting

First sip was delicious and dense, with a perfume-like aromatic note reminiscent of those old potpourri pine cones in mall gift shops. 

Third sip was deeply satisfying. Complex bitterness in the aftertaste, balanced by a gentle sweetness. 

A bit of a small pucker sensation at one point near the back of the tongue, and it feels structured, not harsh.

Still reaching for the word cinnamony, but it is not quite right.

### Reflections

Cold, still morning air through the nose, then a warm sip in presence. Arrau playing Albéniz brought a deep belly relaxation on exhale.

A wider tasting vocabulary would help. Sometimes biochemistry language would fit what is happening in the cup, but plain language may be better when the notes stay honest and specific.
