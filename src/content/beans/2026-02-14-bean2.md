### Context

🦄 made a coffee robot poster for the kitchen brew nook for Valentine's day! Adoration. Pic coming soon.

Haven't been outside much yet. February air wasn't quite as cold in my tshirt as normal when taking out the garbage. Cloudy.

Listened to Peter Steinberger talk about OpenClaw on Lex Friedman while working on some laundry:

Did a few flashcards for `tmux` keyboard shortcuts. 

#### Listening

Brendel playing Beethoven's "Hammerklavier" again this morning. Brings me back.

### Brew Notes

Preheated 209 g purified water and burned off a bit too much; ended up with 


#### New [RDT Atomizer](/beans/equipment/lisapack-rdt-atomizer)

It was easy to put together, very slick. I put purified water in with a tiny funnel and plastic squeezebox bellows synringe by the window.

#### New Hario 03 Brown Cone Filters for the Hario Switch

Finally ran out of the filters that came with the Hario Switch. After a day or two using Melissa O2 "conical" filters (really more of a prism shape), which worked okay, my new Hario 03 brown cone filters came. 

Two aerosol sprays on the dose before grinding. Unscrewed the Timemore catchment ... this RDT aerosolizer works well! Grounds could be tossed and shifted about the grinder catchment cleanly, with little cling on the cup walls.

Ground texture landed right in the workable range: loose enough to move cleanly, tight enough to stay uniform.

### Observations

RDT with the aerosolizer reduced winter static significantly.

Setup was quick and low-cost, and the technique felt repeatable.

#### Groundsniff

I think the RDT changed the character of the smell of the grounds.  It made the particulate matter speak. 
A tunnel to a vibrant underworld, filed with black purple velvet hairs that are glowing.

#### Taste

First, sparkled with acidity and caramel.  
Second, enjoyable, and at a sideways tilt,  
whirling around.  
Third, mohagonay veneer.  
Some wet splash with bright light glare;  
the edge of the tongue with its oils  
like a creme brulee film.  
_n_, finer things of life unlocked. 

### Reflections

Using this aerosolizer is worth keeping as the default workflow going forwards.
