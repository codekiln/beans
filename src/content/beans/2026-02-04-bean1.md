### Setting

#### before

bit of insomnia. got back to sleep with a chilly bedroom. 2nd sleep deep and dream-ladden.  

cleaning my glasses. taste buds won't open until everything's clear.

#### prep

drank chilled spark✨ling water with electolytes

#### listening

### brew notes

asleep! 

watched _The Primeagen_ watch a video of someone configuring Neovim with Nix while brewing. that's one way to greet the day.  

Been taking beans out the night before lately, but this time beans were in freezer before.

solid execution. 

reused a few tips from prior days:
- decrease volume of liquid in 2nd pour of minneature gooseneck kettle for a more even, splashless pour
- measure 500 g water to pout in pan. thought it would be good match with the burn-off, but it was slightly too much.


### observations

was hard to wait until everything was just right to take the first sip: 
the beginning of the song "How to Disappear Completely."

first sip fireworks. what is glancing off the walls?  
sprightly splashy with a balance of acidity  ...

chocolate velvet river. gentle sweetness, but not obvious. 
plenty hot, in the patagonia mug.

as thick as water can be, this cup is dense and complex.

#### write-up technique

tried to use slash commands in codex cli, found out that they weren't there. using rulesync, evidently codex cli slash commands don't autocomplete. they are under "memories" so that's not quite the same thing.
