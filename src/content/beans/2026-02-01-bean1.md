### Setting
Early Sunday and a calm start, settled into a small routine while a Nix tutorial played in the background. 

### Brew Notes
The Switch stayed closed for the full steep, with a centered pour and a deliberately quiet bed.

I filled the gooseneck in two stages to reach the full target, then poured straight down the middle and avoided agitation. The bed finished even and unblemished. I think this rather new detail in the recipe is worth updating. 

### Observations
- Aroma felt clean and open rather than wet.
- First sip brought a bright spark that read as small, quick bursts of acidity.
- Mid-sips turned layered and oily, with a cinnamon-like edge.
- Acidity stayed lively but composed, and the sweetness tucked in underneath.
- Bitterness was earthy and steady, not drying.
- Body was full and balanced, with a lingering earthy finish.

### Reflection
This cup felt like a quiet confirmation. The restrained, centered immersion technique is starting to feel reliable even when my attention is split, and this coffee rewards that composure with clarity and depth.
