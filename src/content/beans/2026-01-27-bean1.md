### Observations
- Started with a video about a new macOS tiling window manager, then shut it off to focus.
- Mocha Java smelled dense and earthy right out of the bag.
- Unicorn mug got a deep two-sniff approval.
- Brew water was steaming with bubbles forming, not yet rolling.
- Drawdown finished faster than usual; only a few dribbles remained.
- First sip: nutty, complex, earthy, with a balanced, dense bitterness.
- About six degrees outside; winter cold sharpened attention.

### Brew log
- RDT-style droplet in the dosing cup to reduce static.
- Forgot to pre-wet the filter before dosing; moved grounds aside to pre-wet.
- Patagonia MiiR mug used to preheat the cone.
- Fast clockwise pour to 210 g, then topped to 255.9 g.
