### Observations
- The cup opened sparkly.
- Balanced acidity up front, nothing sharp.
- As it cooled, nutty overtones came forward and stayed.
- This felt like a reference cup.
- Nothing exaggerated.
- Everything in proportion.

### Brew log
- Even release and a very level bed.
- Clean finish with minimal agitation.
