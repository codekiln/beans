### Observations
- Tasting notes — cup 2 (walking tasting).
- Overall impression: subtle, gentle, well-balanced; quieter than expected.
- Intensity: low–medium; noticeably paler than Parable Mocha Java.
- Sweetness: soft, diffuse sweetness that lives on the edges of the tongue rather than the center.
- Bitterness: present but restrained; slightly elevated by late-contact drips after drawdown.
- Acidity: muted; no sharp point or spark.
- Body: light, a bit airy; no weighty mid-palate.
- Finish: clean, slightly dry; fades rather than resolves.
- Temperature effects: held warmth well due to preheated mug/brewer; flavors opened gently as it cooled.
- Contextual perception: tasted while walking in deep snow just after sunrise (~6°F); crisp air sharpened awareness but did not amplify flavor.
- Comparison anchor: less assertive and less directional than Parable Coffee Co. Mocha Java.
- Meta-note: palate feels unvectored — no clear axis to push sweetness, acidity, or bitterness along.

### Brew log
- Preheated the Patagonia mug and brewer to hold warmth for the walk.
- Allowed late-contact drips after drawdown to finish before heading out.
