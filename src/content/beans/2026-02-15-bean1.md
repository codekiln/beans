`$ bean log 2026-02-15 bean1`

### i. grind

BBC on the radio. Sipping electrolyte water. Slept well.

Used grounds brush that came with the Timemore grinder to clear bottom catchment.  
Some grounds were stubbornly stuck; 1.8 g from yesterday came out.  

Measured 14.3 g of beans to balance that carryover before grinding.

Parable Coffee Co. Mocha Java at 1.8.3 in the Timemore, after two sprays from the new aerosolizer and a shake.

After grinding, unicorn sniffed and agreed it felt flatter than yesterday, even on the newly ground parts. First sniff happened with the cupboard-to-garbage door open, which made smell focus noisy.

Probably an oils story, though unclear exactly which part of that process is shifting.

### ii. brew

Preheated the new brown paper filters, Switch, and Patagonia mug.

Used 256.6 g tap water in the Hario Switch with the Easy Immersion recipe. Hit the switch at 2:30.

The 1:10 to 2:30 immersion window can still pull attention toward side tasks. That habit energy was observed in silence today.

Happy with the new paper filters. They cling to the walls well and feel like they may break down better over time.

Talked with family about the new Hario filters, which somehow turned into "Mario Switch filters." That led to imagining Nintendo coffee filters with little Marios jumping on Goombas, then a short tangent about edible-ink printers.

### iii. transition

Set up writing in Codex Desktop on a different computer than other entries this week, with a bit of juggling.

This morning included a stuck key on the mechanical keyboard, a last-minute keyboard swap, and cloning the repo locally after running out of Codespaces minutes.

The transition path to listening and observing still has some work. 

### iv. listen

Jorge Bolet at Carnegie Hall, New York City, February 25, 1974 (remastered)

The Chopin preludes feel deliciously bittersweet. Reminds me of Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli playing Brahms at times: restraint and patience can be the expression of virility.

Wish this had played during brew instead of BBC; Raindrop Prelude in particular would have supported a mindful brewing.

Grew up playing these preludes, do not remember the experience of playing them as dour, but the place they touch this morning feels like a soft cry in the citadel of lamentation.

### v. observe

Yesterday's second cup still stands out in memory. Today's is delicious in a different, everyday way.

Tap water may be muddying the mix.
