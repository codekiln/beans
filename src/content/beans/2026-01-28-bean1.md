### Observations
- Context: 4:38 a.m. pre-dawn; [listening to Psychic Geography — DOVS](https://open.spotify.com/album/5M2wfJvURaKTP1CA6CUMGt?si=mfTZdrCsRae7NnBefSgIYw).
- Bag notes: honey, berries, orange zest, milk chocolate.
- Roaster profile: easy-drinking, emphasis on bright sweetness; medium to light body.
- Components: Organic Ethiopia Worka Chelbessa; Organic Guatemala COIPEC.
- Roasted on: 11-06-2025 (MM-DD-YYYY on bag).
- Aroma (wet): sweet, nutty.
- First sip: more bitter than yesterday, consistent with the finer grind; still enjoyable and not overwhelming for the morning.
- Second sip: cinnamony notes; with focus, a hint of dried orange zest becomes perceptible.
- Acidity: on the sides of the tongue; reads as malic.
- Sweetness: honey notes largely absent; sweetness is muted.
- Bitterness: not bold; compared to Parable Coffee Co. Mocha Java, this lacks backbone. Bitterness presents as dry rather than structural.
- Body/mouthfeel: thin, aligning with the roaster’s medium to light body.
- Aftertaste: lingers toward the back/roof of the mouth.
- Overall: restrained, calm, easy-drinking; a slight creaminess visible when pouring into the mug.
- Reflection: the uneven bed—clear patches where grounds didn’t cling to the filter wall—made me wonder how much under-extracted coffee was effectively missing from the cup, contributing to thinness and dry bitterness rather than sweetness.

### Brew log
- Preheated mug and dripper with the gooseneck before grinding/measuring.
- Kept a spoon out during dosing; removed a tiny fraction of grounds to hit target weight.
- Initial pour used a clockwise motion, fairly quick, aiming to finish by ~1:00–1:10.
- By 1:20: 256.4 g water in.
- 2:30: dropped the switch.
- During agitation, noticed a milky, frothy, light-colored layer on the surface—more pronounced than yesterday.
- 3:30: bed fully drained; bed looked chunkier and less uniform, with small clear patches along the filter wall.
- Filter: conical paper.
