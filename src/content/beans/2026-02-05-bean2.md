![Ruby Colorful Coffees Organic August bag, unicorn cup, and Switch](/beans/images/2026-02-05-thu-cup2_06_30.png)

### Context
- Early morning, second cup of the day.
- Sparkling water with apple cider vinegar and electrolytes prep the pallette.

### Plan
Easy Immersion with a 16 g dose and ~256 g target water, repeating prior August brews while testing two variables: frozen beans and simulated RDT.

### Technique notes
- Grounds weighed before pre-warming the Switch (noticed late).
- Grounds transferred to the unicorn espresso cup to preserve the measured dose.
- Some fines likely entered the filter during pre-warm, tinting the rinse.
- Realization mid-process: pre-warm pour was not clockwise, contrary to usual habit.
- Kettle heat-management experiment: pre-warm water poured into the gooseneck kettle to retain heat, reducing available brew water.
- Patagonia mug washed between cups to reduce residual oils.
- Dose correction sequence: grounds clung to unicorn mug (~15.9 g), retained grounds in grinder catchment, over-adjusted to ~16.2 g, excess removed back to 16.0 g.
- Chronic variability acknowledged RDT introduces moisture, which gets weighed with the grounds, adding an indestinct amount of extra mass.

### Brew notes (timed)
- Scale not properly zeroed at pour start.
- At ~40 s, apparent reading of ~5 g caused confusion.
- Improvised pour of ~60 g without knowing true cumulative total.
- Total brew water unknown.
- Drawdown complete at 3:40.
- Precision effectively abandoned mid-brew, attempt made to allow the immersion to continue without agitation, nonetheless.

### Observations
- Dry aroma (grounds): spicy, slightly bitter; improved clarity vs prior brews, still not expressing advertised sweetness or fruit.
- Visual: recurring milky-looking film during pour, consistent with prior August cups; bed coloration appeared uneven, possibly related.
- First sip: clearly bitter, more than preferred.
- Second sip: fleeting soapy note with the coffee still present underneath.
- Third sip: fuller body; aftertaste indistinct, muddy rather than expressive.
- Language note: *spurl* -- a personal tasting word for the combined sensation of sour, slightly turning cream and bitter coffee; not clean acidity, not rot; a thin, sharp, spoilage-adjacent edge riding on bitterness.
- Lid-off sipping subtly shifted how the coffee entered the mouth.
- With cream: cream slightly sour/beginning to turn; added funk compounded bitterness into *spurl*.
- Overall: plain, muddy, unremarkable; not bad, but dulled.

### Reflection
This cup is a study in irony. No multitasking or distraction; attention held and still more mistakes than in a while. It suggests attention alone is not enough. Presence without rhythm can still fragment. The bitterness likely came from a stack of small imprecisions rather than any single variable. The coffee does not punish those slips; it simply becomes ordinary. That ordinariness is instructive. If there are no bad cuts now and then, what do good cuts mean? Presence can hold even with a botched, muddy cup, letting it remind what steadiness feels like when it returns.
