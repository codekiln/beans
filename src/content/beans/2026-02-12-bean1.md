### Brew Notes
- Grind: 1.8.3 on Timemore C5 ESP Pro
- Recipe: Easy Immersion
- Coffee: Ruby Colorful Coffees Organic August blend
- Dose: 16.0 g
- Water: 159.9 g (tap)

### Observations

Using cream, it is a bold cup. At the same time, a bit of a hollow ring. Like a wooden hall where the wind causes a standing wave.
