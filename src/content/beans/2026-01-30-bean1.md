## Observations

### Set and Setting
- Listening to the album Psychic Geography by DOVS [spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/5M2wfJvURaKTP1CA6CUMGt?si=Rmi9JPB0TPaD88bUh1akSg).

### Tasting
- First sip was taken with the plastic lid on the Patagonia mug while standing at my computer. 
- The first thing I noticed was the bitterness.
- In the next two sips, some gentle hints of sweetness and roundness appeared.
- At the back of my throat, there was a lingering sweetness that balanced the initial bitterness.

## Brew Notes

While brewing, I used a technique kind of like RDT where I put a few drops of water on the beans after weighing them before putting them in the grinder and shake them up. In the past I have called this "Simulated RDT."
