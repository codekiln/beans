## Observations
- Early morning second cup in a quiet kitchen with pre-dawn light.
- The lingering mood of Doves — "Psychic Geography" sat in the background.
- Aroma: mild and restrained.
- First sip (black): less bitter than cup one, noticeable nuttiness, more rounded.
- Mid-cup: acidity dominates and the cup feels thin and muted.
- Bitterness: present but controlled, not drying or harsh.
- Sweetness: subtle and secondary.
- Body: light, bordering on thin.
- Temperature: notably "just right" throughout the cup.
- With half & half: acidity softens and the cup becomes smoother and more cohesive.
- Coarser grind improved balance, but bean age feels like the limiting factor.

## Brew log
- Coarser grind than cup one to reduce bitterness and improve roundness.
- Grind accidentally started at 1.8.0, then adjusted up to 1.8.3 to finish.
- Standard rinse and placement with a conical paper filter.
