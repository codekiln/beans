`$ bean log 2026-02-15 bean2`

### i. grind

Second cup started with a small calibration puzzle: measured 15.9 g because there was about 0.1 g lingering in the Timemore grinder from earlier.

Ground at 1.8.3 again, which has been the stable home setting lately.

Used the RDT aerosolizer again (same as cup one). There was still a little clumping at the bottom, but noticeably less stubborn than the first cup of the day.

When the catchment came off, the aroma rose deeper and more complex than expected. The moment felt like a seance for language: attentive, waiting, seeing what words might precipitate out.

### ii. brew

Used purified water and the new brown filters.

Tried a slight process update for preheat: poured the full 300 ml into the Hario Switch, then let that drain into the Patagonia mug.

Previous preheat runs used only 200 ml to match gooseneck capacity; this time skipped the gooseneck for preheat entirely.

Also wiped down the Maestri House timer with a microfiber cloth. It had become stained. Care in cleaning.  

### iii. observe

The grinder still has not had a deep clean.

It raised the cast-iron question: once something is seasoned, what should be left alone versus scrubbed back to neutral?

Soap-and-water cleaning on the Switch, mug, and small grounds cups seems to preserve cup clarity. Grinder maintenance is less obvious and worth proper research.

### iv. action items

- Look up grinder-cleaning cadence and whether retained oils can ever be beneficial.
- Add a possible research-entry type to the beans log for standalone notes and mini essays.
- Add terminology entries (for example, RDT) so recurring brew terms have a canonical home.

Final grounds check: output landed at 15.8 g, so the retained amount was slightly overestimated.

### v. tasing

bitter first and second sips.  
it's a corkscrew shaped taste.
