## Observations
- First sip was mocha-forward.
- A small, delicate burst right on the tongue.
- Bitterness dropped into the range I like.
- When I pressed my tongue to the roof of my mouth while swishing, the bitterness registered as a high-pitched tone — felt behind the eyes rather than on the tongue.
- Overcast.
- Snowstorm imminent but not yet started.
- The cup felt alert, not heavy.

## Brew log
- Simulated RDT by wetting the mug before dosing.
- Slightly hotter slurry for the first minute.
