### Context
- Cup 2 of Wednesday, 2026-02-11.
- Brewed at 7:06 a.m.
- Coffee: Ruby Colorful Coffees Organic Odyssey Seasonal blend.
- Roast date: 2025-11-06.
- Out on a walk: wet sidewalks after overnight snow, pink morning light, and a little less cold than recent mornings.
- Carried the mug bare-handed comfortably.

### Listening
Schubert, characteristic march for piano duo.

This is the walk companion today: jaunty, steady, almost horse-like in its rhythmic click.

### Brew Notes
- Recipe: Easy Immersion.
- Water: 255.7 g.
- Added cream (continuing the cream habit for this older roast).
- Brought ice walkers, but did not need them yet.

### Observations
First sips brought little ticklish waves on the tongue, like tiny pulses moving in and out.

The mouthfeel felt shape-driven and physical: little pyramids and egg-like forms bumbling around on the taste buds, as if a heterogeneous mixture were rolling through the sip.

The listening and walking synced with the cup. The march's jaunty click helped pace each step and sip.

### Reflection
I keep reaching for the word _complex_ and feel frustrated by it.

Right now, the better task is focus: narrowing the language lens so each note names one concrete sensation instead of collapsing everything into that one broad word.
