### observation

#### sniffing the grounds

> "a deep purple nebula" --🦄

#### listening

continuing _Brace for Impact_ by Hampus Lindwall from yesterday. The second track _swerve_ has an amazing soundstage on my IEMs.

Snapping and popping reminds me of world three, _Vanilla Dome_ in _Super Mario World_:

Pipe organ always reminds me of Kali Malone at first but this is more brutal and flustered, a bit of a demonic kaliope, sort of like if Conlon Nancarrow composed for player organ. Makes me imagine that I'm in the Organ Room from [House on the Rock](https://www.thehouseontherock.com):

#### tasting

- mouth body is a bit different with has chocolate's bitters. delicious. 
- purified water, the feel here is thinner?

#### reflection

haven't been logging as frequently. adherence < consistency. at least once a day, I want to sit down with a cup of coffee and write with some music. it doesn' thave to be long.
