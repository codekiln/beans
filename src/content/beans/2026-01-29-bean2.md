### Observations
- Context: second cup of the day, late morning edging into commute; walking in ~6F cold with gloves, phone, and mug.
- Mood: a little tired from yesterday's caffeine and a late night, but settled and receptive.
- Music: DOVS - muted, textural, 1990s Autechre-adjacent; steadying and inward-facing.
- Aroma: earthy, grounded, slightly muted but inviting.
- First sip: earthy and bold; immediately reassuring.
- Subsequent sips: full-bodied and easy drinking, especially with cream.
- Acidity: low but present; adds roundness rather than brightness.
- Sweetness: chocolate-adjacent; softened by cream but still legible.
- Bitterness: nutty, cocoa-like; restrained, functioning as weight rather than edge.
- Body/mouthfeel: full; engaging across roof, surface, and sides of the tongue.
- Aftertaste: nutty, chocolatey, lingering without dryness.
- Overall: comforting, integrated, forgiving; a cup that supports thought rather than demanding attention.
- Reflection: enjoyment and attentiveness matter more than purity. The cream lowers temperature and contrast without erasing character; in the cold and fatigue it reads as a stabilizing field rather than something to optimize.

### Brew log
- Easy Immersion plan with the switch closed for a ~2:30 steep.
- Dose and water matched earlier cup; grind unchanged at 1.8.3 as baseline.
- 0:00 pour to full volume, valve closed.
- 2:30 valve opened; ~3:30 drawdown complete.
- Straightforward drawdown with no stalling or channeling observed.
- Added a small amount of cream after brew, softening edges and cooling the cup slightly.
