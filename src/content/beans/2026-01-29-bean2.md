## Observations
- Second cup held a softer edge with a calm, sweet finish.
- Bitterness stayed minimal; sweetness carried longer on the finish.
- Texture felt rounder as the cup cooled.

## Brew log
- Slightly coarser grind and the same ratio as the first cup.
- Pour finished around 1:05, release at 2:32.
- Drawdown smooth with a clean bed.
