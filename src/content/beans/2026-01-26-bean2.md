### Observations
- First sip: nutty, dense, immediately more balanced than cup 1.
- Bitterness present but controlled, no longer gating the flavor.
- A slight zingle sits adjacent to sweetness.
- Later sips reveal emerging sweetness.
- A faint berry note appears on the mid-palate.
- Finish evokes burnt sienna and warm earth tones.
- Blizzard aftermath: sidewalks freshly cleared, powdery snow drifting down.
- Cars across the street snowed in up to the wheels.
- On-campus work canceled for a snow day; Debussy in the background.

### Brew log
- Paper filter fully seated and pressed to cone walls.
- Fast, confident clockwise pour; ~200 mL in quickly, all water in by ~1:00.
- Switch closed during pour with no early drip-through.
- Switch depressed at 2:30; drawdown complete by 3:48.
- Grounds clung to the catchment, likely from residual moisture.
