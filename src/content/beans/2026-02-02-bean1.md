### Setting

During the brew I was talking with my 🦄. 

#### Discussion
🦄 had snif of the beans first, then the grounds later.  Talking about social remorse, conversations, family, and a recent episode of _This American Life_. 

#### Listening
It was my 2nd day listening to album _Double Infinity_ by Big Thief. I'm really digging this album. Lenker is so chill on the song "No Fear."

Track 7, "Grandmother," reminds me of the vibe of [Krishna Das](https://open.spotify.com/album/1coxyhjee04qEyUWfzLaZM?si=nTTfgzdCTnKp3iBEdlLnWw).

### Brew Notes

Execution was fairly precise. I have muscle memory for the recipe at this point.

#### Concurrent Warming

I let the Hario Switch pre-pour flow halfway through to the mug (~100 mL). Idea is that this lets me pre-heat the mug faster, rather than warming the Switch's glass and the mug in serial.

### Observation

🦄 said the sojourner groundsmell had the chocolate depth and I concurred.

The first sip had a glare, a stiff side-glance. Delicious and complex.

I had a hard time getting to the point where I could post, because I needed to remind myself of tmux commands. Not the space I want to in be for tasting! 

I had codex enqueue a new slash command to enable creating a new post. 

This morning I found that I was missing some of the hydration needed to sip the full cup. I need more cold water with electrolytes in the morning.
