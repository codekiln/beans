### Set

Setting an intention to be present. These brews are about maximizing the integral over the moment in brew and in sip.
Waited about 20-40 min before first cup of day.

#### Listen

Claudio Arrau playing "Chopin: 26 Preludes, 4 Impromptus"

Find the low A♭ bass note at the end of Op 28, No. 17. That piano has a magnificent tone under Arrau's weight:

Consider the neck-shivering parallel chord descent at 1:39, summon the winter wind:

### Brew

Standard execution. 

I was multitasking at the time, watching some YouTube videos about the [ZimaBoard 2](https://shop.zimaspace.com/products/zimaboard2-single-board-server).

### Observe

#### GroundsSniff

>  "deep and woody, like a dried out stack of wood" -- 🦄

There's a difference with the mocha java: 

> "not quite as purple-smelling" -- 🦄

#### Sip
Aroma of the coffee through the lid is appetizing.  
First sip is just a bit cooler than expected.  
A bit of sweetness.  
Taking the lid off, cannot smell it better.  
The steam is certainly hot.  
Second sip brings sawtooth to foreground.  
Rugged balance.  
Sip three, breathe through nose in and out, presence.  
Oils.  
Childhood memory of coffee candy, back throat.  
Two flavors on a seasaw, playing with each other mid-tongue.    
Well-balanced. 

#### Dis-*tractaction*

- nice, `<prefix> ?` brings up tmux keyshorts
- fix the blockquote style
- how does one delete with copy mode visual seletion in tmux? vim keyshort `d` doesn't work
- figuring out how to get Codex CLI to "find" the Playwright skill available in Codex Desktop

#### Reflect

The glass is clearest when the hands are free.  
Set things down to see farther.
