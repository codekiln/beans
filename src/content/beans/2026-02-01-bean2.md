### Brew Notes
Early morning, second cup. The kitchen was quiet with daylight settling in, and I paused for a brief moment of levity while sniffing the unicorn mug before pouring.

Pre-warmed the Switch and filter, then stuck with the Easy Immersion routine: a predictable 1.8.3 grind and no intentional changes. I only realized after the cup that the brewer or my Patagonia mug may not have been fully cleaned between the first and second brew, as the water was a bit brown in the pan.

This coffee tends to produce milky swirls during the pour-in before immersion. 

In the 2nd pour (200-256 mL), an even foam ring with very fine bubbles formed; a darker central island remained visible as I topped it off.

Spent bed showed slight stickiness at the bottom, with a few patchy holes consistent with prior brews of this coffee.

### Observations
- Aroma (dry grounds): unexpectedly complex; layered, but difficult to separate into distinct notes.
- Aroma (cup): distinctly wet and subdued rather than aromatic.
- First sip (black): light and easy drinking; caramel-forward.
- Second sip: gentle sweetness; impressionistic, kaleidoscopic rather than sharply defined.
- Chocolate note: closer to milk chocolate than dark.
- With cream: significantly fuller and more integrated; flavors enter smoothly rather than striking.
- Acidity: restrained; possible hint of orange zest without brightness.
- Sweetness: soft, caramel-like.
- Body/mouthfeel: increases notably with cream; flowing rather than coating.
- Visual extraction read: calm center with an even perimeter suggests localized channeling rather than global over-agitation.
- Overall gestalt: friendly, coherent, quietly expressive.

### Reflection
This cup reinforced how well the coffee accommodates cream, gaining body and dimensionality without losing its gentle character. The aged roast and visually calm extraction traded brightness for flow and cohesion. The faint brown tinge in the pre-warm water leaves an open question about between-cup cleanliness subtly shaping the cup more than grind or timing.
