### Brew Notes

Beans came out of the freezer.

Standard Easy immersion recipe on the Hario Switch. No multitasking. 

### Observation

Sniffed the grounds with my pet 🦄. It's like a pipeline smell. 

First sip reminded me of burnt coffee, but this coffee wasn't burnt. Even so, should I be backing off the temperature of the water? It's not a rolling boil, it's not even steaming. I bring it up until it steams, preheat, put water back in, bring back up for a few seconds, then brew. 

Wonder what others do for measuring water temp. 

Almost didn't write this morning; sometimes consistency is friction.  

It's a delicious juicyness. I love this bag of coffee. Need to order more soon.
