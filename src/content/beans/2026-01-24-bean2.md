## Observations
- Walking outside.
- ~10°F.
- Pink and purple on the horizon.
- Listening to the final minutes of Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3.
- Eyes watered while drinking.
- Then Bach: Partita No. 2 in C minor.
- Wanted to sit down and play.
- The cold sharpened everything.
- The coffee felt grounding against the music — less about flavor notes, more about staying present in the body.

## Brew log
- Outdoor brewing, wind shielding with the mug.
- Longer drawdown from cold air.
