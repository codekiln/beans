## History Notes from [bean log 2026-02-03 bean1](/beans/log/2026-02-03-bean1/)

[Mocha](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1J3LUUkKZMR6bKd29) in "mocha-java" was a port city at the edge of the Red Sea in [Yemen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oLJesEDvx6aSxpw88) where Yemen's coffee was exported to the rest of the world. Coffee was grown inland in the highlands but took on the name of the port where it was exported.
