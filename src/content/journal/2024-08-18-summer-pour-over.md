- Bloom at 0:00 with 60g, gentle swirl.
- Main pour in two stages to 200g and 320g.
- Drawdown finished ~3:10.

**Observations**
- Bright mandarin up front with a nutty finish.
- Slightly under-extracted; next time grind one click finer.

**Thoughts**
Today felt like a slow exhale. The ritual kept the day from fraying.
