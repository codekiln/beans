A slow, quiet brew. Bloomed with 45g for 45 seconds, then finished in two pours.
The cup opened with raspberry jam and a gentle cocoa finish. I felt more patient
than usual — the pour cadence stayed even, and the bitterness never spiked.

Notes to revisit: try a slightly finer grind next time to add weight without
losing clarity.
