    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Beans is a log of coffee, tools, attention, and mornings. Each bean marks a single
      moment — a cup with a record of choices, weather, and how it landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interface borrows from command-line notation, but the goal is readability and
      clarity. Observations are written as plainly as possible, with structure that makes
      change easy to notice.
