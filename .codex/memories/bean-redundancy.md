# Bean entry redundancy rule

Do not duplicate information within a bean entry.

## Application

- Avoid repeating identical facts across sections.
- Avoid repeating frontmatter metadata in the markdown body unless interpretation or new context is added.
- Prefer one clear mention over repeated phrasing (especially for repeated technical terms).
