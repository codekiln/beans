# Bean tag purpose and style

Use tags as lightweight cross-entry filters only when the signal is not already represented in structured metadata.

## Rules

- Always include `listening` when a bean entry includes listening notes or embeds.
- Use namespaced tags with hierarchy ordered general to specific (for example: `water/tap`, `water/purified`, `friction/transition`).
- Keep tags high-signal and concise; avoid near-duplicate synonyms.
- Never exceed 5 tags on a bean entry.
- Do not tag information already present in frontmatter fields (cup index, date/day, brewer, grinder, recipe, roaster, roast, or other explicit metadata).
