# Additional Conventions Beyond the Built-in Functions

As this project's AI coding tool, you must follow the additional conventions below, in addition to the built-in functions.

# Beans Project Overview

Beans is a CLI-inspired coffee log built with Astro. The site content lives in `src/content` and content helpers live in `src/data`; the UI is composed of Astro components, layouts, and styles in `src/`.

## General Guidelines

- Always generate previews using the `/beans/` base prefix (for example: `/beans/log/<slug>`).
- When a user requests changes, load `AGENTS.md` first and provide a preview in ChatGPT Codex.
- Follow existing project conventions and patterns; mirror nearby code style when editing files.
- Prefer small, focused changes that keep the CLI-inspired tone of the site intact.
- Use the existing utilities (such as `withBase`) for building paths and links.
- Keep content changes in `src/content` and presentation changes in `src/components`, `src/layouts`, or `src/styles`.
- Keep the primary descriptive content for data models in the markdown body, not frontmatter arrays.
- When adding new pages, use `.astro` files and include the base layout.

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use double quotes for strings.
- Keep markup and text line wrapping consistent with surrounding files.

## RuleSync Workflow

- Update the unified rules in `.rulesync/rules/`.
- Regenerate AI tool configs with `npx rulesync generate` after changing rules.

## Node Version Alignment

- Use `.nvmrc` as the single source of truth for the Node version.
- GitHub Actions and the devcontainer must both read the Node version from `.nvmrc` (do not hardcode version numbers elsewhere).
